title: Initialise your project folder
---

## Run npm init

:sunglasses: `npm init` sets up your project folder as a node project and creates `package.json`. This is where the installed modules are recorded.

Open a command line, like Cmd, or Git Bash.

Change directory to the folder you created on the previous page, for example:

Cmd - `cd c:\Users\MyUserName\Documents\Projects\Tutorial`
Git bash - `cd /c/Users/MyUserName/Documents/Projects/Tutorial'

Now run npm init to set up your folder as a JavaScript project:

`npm init`

This will then ask you a lot of questions. For now, just press enter to accept all the defaults. 

:bulb: Before sharing your project with others you should edit `package.json` and set the values for your project. There's [more information about package.json here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json).
