title: Check Node is installed - Mac
---

## Do you have Node.js and npm installed already?

Cypress is written in JavaScript and needs Node which is a JavaScript runtime engine.

We recommend Node.js version 18.13.0 LTS (includes npm 8.19.3).

Open a terminal window and run:

```bash
node -v
```

This should print the version number so youâ€™ll see something like this `v18.13.0`.

We recommend Node.js version v18.13.0 LTS (Long term support)

If you see an error message or a different version please [:point_right: install Node](../c1e3/c1e3mac.md).

## :bulb: How to check if npm is installed

Open the command line, and type:

```bash
npm -v
```

You should see something like this `8.19.3`.

:sunglasses: 'npm' is 'Node Package Manager'. It let's you install third party JavaScript libraries and use them with Node.js. There are thousands of free modules available, including Cypress!
