title: Check Node is installed
---

## Do you have Node.js and NPM installed already?

Cypress is written in JavaScript and needs Node which is a JavaScript runtime engine.

We recommend Node.js version v14.17.

## :bulb: How to check if Node is installed

Open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool, and type:

```bash
node -v
```

This should print the version number so youâ€™ll see something like this `v16.18.1`.

We recommend Node.js version v16.18.1

If you see an error message or a different version please [:point_right: install Node](../c1e3/c1e3.md).

## :bulb: How to check if NPM is installed

Open the command line, and type:

```bash
npm -v
```

You should see something like this `8.19.2`.

__[:heavy_check_mark: Yes, Node v16.18 and NPM are already installed on my computer](../c1e4/c1e4.md)__

__[:point_right: I need to install Node and NPM](../c1e3/c1e3.md)__

:sunglasses: NPM is 'Node Package Manager'. It let's you install third party JavaScript libraries and use them with Node.js. There are thousands of free modules available, including Cypress!
