description: Check Node is installed
---

## Do you have Node.js and NPM installed already?

Node is needed for running Cypress and other JavaScript applications on your computer.

We recommend Node.js version v14.17.6.

__[:heavy_check_mark: Yes, Node v14.17 and NPM are already installed on my computer](../../c2/c1e4/c1e4.md)__

__[:point_right: I need to install Node and NPM](../c1e3/c1e3.md)__

:sunglasses: NPM is 'Node Package Manager'. It let's you install third party JavaScript libraries and use them with Node.js. There are thousands of free modules available, including Cypress!
