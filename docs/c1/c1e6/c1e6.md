## Install Cypress

From the command line, change to your project directory, and run:

`npm install cypress`

If Windows Firewall or Windows Defender offers to unblock Cypress, allow it to have access to all networks. It needs to connect to external websites and APIs.

âŒš It can take a few minutes for Cypress to install.
