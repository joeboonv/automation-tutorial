1. Restart your computer if prompted

1. Check Node and NPM are installed

   - Open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool, and type:

     ```bash
     node -v
     ```

     This should print the version number so youâ€™ll see something like this `v16.18.1`.

     We recommend Node.js version v16.18.1

   - Also on the command line, type:

     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```

     You should see something like this `8.19.2`.

## All done?
