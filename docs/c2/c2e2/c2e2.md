## Opening your test project in Visual Studio Code
Assuming you've successfully installed Visual Studio Code and opened the app you can now open your test project.

1. In Visual Studio select File > Open Folder
1. Browse for and select the project folder you created earlier

This can be done one of two ways, through the Cypress App or via the project in Visual Studio.

1. Navigate to the e2e folder in the explorer pane on the left
1. Right click the folder and select 'New File'
1. Name the new file 'exercise 1'
