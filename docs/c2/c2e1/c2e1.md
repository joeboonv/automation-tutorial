title: Introduction to Mocha
---

Mocha is a JavaScript test framework, which was created to be simple, extensible and fast. It's used for both unit and integration testing, and is also a greate candidate for BDD. Cypress has adopted Mocha's BDD syntax and all of the tests we will be writing sit on the fundamental harness that Mocha provides.

Over the duration of this course we will be using the Mocha BDD interface:

- describe() - contains the tests for a feature
- it() - a single test containing the test steps

For example:
```
  describe('basket page', () => {
    it('can remove an item from the basket', () => {});
    it('increments item quantity', () => {});
  });
```

You should be able to read the label in the 'describe' followed by the label in the 'it' together as a sentence, e.g.

"basket page can remove an item from the basket"

For larger test suites you can nest multiple describes inside a describe.
