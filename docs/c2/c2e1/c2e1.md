title: Introduction to Mocha
---

Mocha is a JavaScript test framework, which was created to be simple, extensible and fast. It's used for both unit and integration testing, and is also a greate candidate for BDD. Cypress has adopted Mocha's bdd syntax and all of the test we will be writing sit on the fundamental harness that Mocha provides.

Over the duration of this course we will be using the Mocha BDD interface, namely:

- describe()
- it()
- before()
- beforeEach()
- afterEach()
- after()
- .only()
- .skip()
